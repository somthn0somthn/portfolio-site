I’m Luke Mahoney, a Technical Program Manager specializing in integrations and infrastructure. I’ve spent 4+ years leading delivery of developer tools, blockchain infrastructure, and production DeFi applications across globally distributed engineering teams.

I’ve driven program delivery across 40+ grant-funded initiatives (~$4–5M USD), coordinating Rust and Haskell engineers building on Cardano, Polkadot, and Solana. I’ve written whitepapers, contributed to protocol design, and supported mainnet launches, including Cardano’s flagship algorithmic stablecoin.

Currently based in Japan. This site collects my writing on program delivery, distributed teams, and systems work, alongside personal projects in Rust and C.
