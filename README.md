# Luke Mahoney Portfolio Site

This repo hosts my personal portfolio and writing site.

I’m Luke Mahoney, a Technical Program Manager focused on integrations and infrastructure. I’ve led delivery of developer tooling, blockchain infrastructure, and production DeFi work across globally distributed teams, and coordinated 40+ grant-funded initiatives. I'm currently based in Japan.

In my portfolio, you’ll find:

- **Writing** on program delivery, distributed teams, TIL technical posts, and systems work
- **Projects** and experiments I’m building

## Built on an excellent template

Special thanks to **Tim Lrx** for the **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog** template. It’s a fantastic foundation, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a clean Next.js + Tailwind + MDX setup:
